### Introduction
Here I list out some notes for the financial terms and concepts that I learn along the way.


## Notes
```
Market Cap = Share Price Ã— Number of Outstanding Shares
```
- The total value of a company

Indices: plural for index


**Market cap weighted index:**, the "weight" or importance of each company within the index is determined by its market cap.
- A company with a larger market cap will have a larger proportion (weight) in the index than a company with a smaller market cap.

```
cumulative market cap = MarketCap(CompanyA) + MarketCap(CompanyB) + MarketCap(CompanyC).
```


The **overall value and performance** of a market cap weighted index is determined by the **combined market values of the companies it holds**. 
- Also means, that companies with higher market caps have a bigger influence on the index's movements.


## Universe & Propotion

**Universe** This refers to the entire pool of potential stocks that could be included in the index. For example, the "universe" for the S&P 500 might be all publicly traded companies in the US, but only the largest 500 (based on certain criteria) make it into the actual index.

**Proportion:** This means the index fund has a rule about how much of the total "universe" it will invest in. This rule is often a limit or a threshold.

### Implication
The "proportion" might be a specific number of companies, or companies above a certain market cap, or companies that collectively represent a certain percentage of the total market.

## Missing Data
- I think in order to do the rebalancing, we need the price of the shares.
